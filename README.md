# Notes
- ratio always front / back
- Going over is a bust
- some index can be skipped by checking bookends
- after checking bookends, will also know if should loop up, or down
- multiple indexes will have a 'match'
- - ~~thus should loop through the smaller list and then compare champions~~
- - No, loop through larger index, The inner loop is more likely to generate skips
- Don't compare champions, keep running best
