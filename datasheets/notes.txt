- know very little about selecting the switch for a switching converter
- Page 8 of the control unit's data sheet outlines the selection params for the external components
-"The main selection criteria for
the power MOSFET are the threshold voltage V GS(TH) and
the “on” resistance R DS(ON) , reverse transfer capacitance
and total gate charge."
- so the minimum voltage to turn on the switch
- the IRF7202 matches the 70170 at -1.0V
- the min is -0.5, which to me means the switch might not turn off fully
- The second bit on R DS(ON) is the resistance across the switch, which I think we want low as possible.
- the IRF7202 is about 0.25 ohms
- the NDS9405 is about 0.065 ohms
- the origninal 70170 is about 0.0.08 ohms
- So the IRF7202 would have more power loss, driving down the total efficiency of the switching converter.
=========================
- Unless after asking a team member about the lower threshold voltage; I would select the IRF7202 even though it has a lower efficiency.
I'm less worried that it would outright break the circuit.
